        <p> Welcome! Im Ray and I'm student with devCodeCamp learning SoftWare Development! So far ive learned 
            about Javascrpt and html5! As an assignment I was tasked to build this site using the skills I've learned!

            <article>
                <p>My name is Raimon Hubbard but I go by Ray! Currently, I study software devlopement at devCodeCamp! I'm originally from 
                    Michigan, but as of this year I'm based out of Little Rock Arkansas. I first became interested in IT during my time in 
                    the Navy. When I got out, I decided to take classes but I quickly lost interest and got a job at the US Postal Service.
                    I worked there for a year and made good money but... there was still something missing.....One day I was bored and  
                    looking to download games. I made a mistake and downloaded Sololearn. Not knowing what it was, I opened the app and 
                    5 minutes later I printed "Hello World" for the first time. Ive been in love ever since! From there I set out looking 
                    for more information about the field. After some thought I decided to change my career! Though I knew the journey wouldnt be easy, I 
                    admit I underestimated how dificult it would be to learn this craft. After trying to learn on my own for a little less than a year
                    I kept running into concepts I couldn't understand for the life of me! That how I becaeme a student at devCodeCamp! Its been one 
                    of, if not the most, challenging courses I've ever taken but fun at the same time! So far we have covered javascript
                    and html5. Learning Javascript was challenging! Its literally like learning a new language. Any slip of the tongue 
                    and you wont be able to get your message across the way you intended. My first project will show a basic trip 
                    randomizer. Using functions and conditional statements I created an application that randomly selects a trip for the 
                    user. To see more of my projects visit the PROJECTS section of this site... Speaking of site.. this website youre viewing was created
                    by me as my second project! I made it using html5 and css. How does it look? Any feedback is well appreciated!

                    <p>I was stationed in Norfolk, Va onboard the aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman. I served onboard the flight 
                    deck as an Aircraft Director. During my enlistment I deployed 2 times with the USS Harry S Truman and I 
                    volunteered to deploy with the USS George Bush. I was honorably discharged on 2017.

            While this website itself serves as a project, I currently have one other project that randomizes a trip for you.
